## Determine how age affects insurance costs

This report summarises the finding and detail analysis of how age affects insurance costs. To start, we will import packages that will help us manipulate data and leverage the easy-to-use machine learning tools from the scikit-learn library. Then, we will load our data into a pandas DataFrame. 

A linear model describes a linear relationship between an input and output variable. We therefore need to make sure that the problem we are looking to model with Linear Regression indeed has a continuous input and output variable with a linear relationship. In this report we have a scatter plot of the insurance charges data. We can observe the relationship between age and insurance cost
